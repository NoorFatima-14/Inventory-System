# Inventory System

## About the Project

This Inventory System is a simple console-based application written in C++. It is designed to help businesses manage their inventory effectively. The system allows users to add new products, manage sales, restock items, and check the current inventory. Built using a linked list structure, it offers dynamic management of inventory items, making it suitable for small to medium-sized operations.

## Features

- **Add New Inventory Items**: Add items with a unique ID, name, quantity, and price to the system.
- **Make Sales**: Process sales by deducting quantities from inventory and calculating total costs.
- **Restock Inventory**: Update the stock levels by adding quantities to existing items from suppliers.
- **Check Inventory Levels**: View the current stock of all items, including their ID, quantity, and price.

## Characteristics

- **Linked List Data Structure**: Ensures efficient memory usage and flexibility in managing items dynamically.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple console-based interface with clear prompts and options for the user.
- **Basic Error Handling**: Prevents invalid operations such as selling more items than available in stock.

## Conclusion

The Inventory System provides a straightforward solution for managing stock levels in small-scale operations. Its simplicity and use of a linked list ensure efficient handling of dynamic data, making it easy to add, remove, and manage inventory items. The system helps keep track of sales and stock while maintaining an intuitive user interface. This project can serve as a foundational system that can be expanded and adapted for more complex use cases in the future.
